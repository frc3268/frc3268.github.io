HELLO THERE! We're from Inglemoor High School, a public high school northeast of Lake Washington (the Seattle water area) that is also known for its ~~snobby~~ IB program and really cool students.

We compete in the [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) through [FIRSTWA](https://firstwa.org/) with teams from across the Pacific Northwest.  

We pride ourselves in being an enviornement where anyone can contribute and develop their skills in STEM, regardless of external characteristics.  

The FRC entails us building a robot which completes a series of objectives, like picking up a ball or climing up monkey bars, within a period of 6 weeks. This is obviously not an *ideal* amount of time, so we meet often and work hard to create something which will meet and surpass those objectives. Additional info about these objectives is availible on our [resources](https://www.valhallabots.tech/resources/) page.   

As stated previously, we do not judge based off of external characteristics, so membership in the club is open to all Inglemoor HS Students, free of charge, and all we ask is that you bring your unique skills to the table to help the team.
