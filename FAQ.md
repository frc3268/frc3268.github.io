HELLO THERE! We're from Inglemoor High School, a public high school northeast of Lake Washington (the Seattle water area) that is also known for its ~~snobby~~ IB program and really cool students.

We compete in the [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) through [FIRSTWA](https://firstwa.org/) with teams from across the Pacific Northwest.
