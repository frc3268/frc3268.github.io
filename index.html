        <h1>About Us</h1>
          <h2>Hello again! We're the Inglemoor Robotics Club, hailing from Inglemoor HS in Kenmore, Washington (east of seattle).
        We compete in the FRC, or FIRST Robotics Competition, which entails us building a robot to complete a set challenge in a whopping 6 weeks! Blink, and you'll miss it.
        We gladly accept any and all prospective members(who are students in the NSD, as per school policy) to our team - we want you!
        We meet often, both during and outside the 6 week "build season" designated for the - you guessed it - building of our robot.
        The culmination of our efforts comes in two yearly competitions which we attend (dates pending), where we showcase our robot and field it with and against teams from across the PNW.
            Now, go ahead and <a onclick="document.getElementById('scheduling').scrollIntoView({behavior: 'smooth'})">scroll down</a> to check out when (and how often) we meet.
          </h2>

          <h1>Scheduling</h1>
          <h2>
            Generally speaking, this club meets on Monday after school (from 3:15 to 4:20), and on Wednesday during Viking time (from 11:05 to 11:50) every week, in room 301 (aka the old band room).
            If there is a day in which we do not meet, or if there is a special meeting called for some purpose, it will be announced on the discord server or via email.
            We <strong>very strongly</strong> encourage you to attend the team's meetings on Mondays, as they are critical for skill-building and demonstrate commitment, something which we value a lot.

            </h2><h2>Info on competitions and build season is currently pending, but the general rule is that during build season (from January until the start of Spring Break), we meet 4-5 days a week, for about 2 hours per day, due to the increased workload which the build season brings.
          If you want to learn <em>even more</em> about our team (or if you're looking for documentation), <a onclick="document.getElementById('resources').scrollIntoView({behavior: 'smooth'})">scroll down </a> to find our resources page.
