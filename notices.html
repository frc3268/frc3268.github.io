  <h2><strong>Parts came in!</strong></h2>
  <p>
    Recently, we received most of the parts we had been waiting on in order to begin construction of the robot. This includes 10 Kraken motors, a drill mill and lots of metal, among other things. This means that we are going to be doing a lot in the coming days and weeks. <br>
    <strong>To account for the loss of school during the snow days, we have decided to hold meetings on Fridays, including the 14th of Febuary.</strong> These meetings will go until 5:20. In addition, we <strong>will be holding meetings on every weekday of mid-winter break.</strong> Exact schedule is TBA, but they will likely be in the afternoon.
    <br> We <strong>strongly encourage</strong> attendance to these meetings, as well as our regularly scheduled ones. These upcoming weeks will be critial to getting the robot done on time for competition, so we need <strong>all hands on deck.</strong>

  <h2><strong>Important Dates</strong></h2>
  <p><strong>Tuesday, January 28, After School:</strong> Final Design Review. We will go over the final design as a team, so Be There Or Be Square. This is the best time to get questions about the design answered. <strong>Attendance is strongly encouraged for everyone.</strong>
    <br><strong>Wednesday, January 29, Viking Time:</strong> Safety Talk with Coach Matt. As we are expecting some new tooling to come in the coming days/ weeks, it's important to know how to use everything safely. <strong>Attendance is strongly encouraged for all members of the Mechanical team.</strong></p>

  <h2><strong>Issues as of 1/22</strong></h2>
  <p><strong>Swerve</strong>: one of the swerve modules is "locked in place" -- that is, <strong>the wheel won't move</strong>. There is definitely an issue with the gears. Some of them are tilted. A fix will probably require some taking apart of the offending swerve module.
    <br><strong>Electronics</strong>: The new radio (vividhosting model) <strong>will not connect to the computers</strong>. This is likely some issue with how we are configuring it.
    <br> <strong>Operations</strong>: Procurement is causing delays. <strong>Parts have not arrived</strong> and this is slowing down progress.</p>

  <h2><strong>Reefscape 2025 Kicks Off</strong></h2>
  <p>The 2025 FRC season kicked off on January 4, 2025, with a meeting at inglemoor to mark the event. The game, Reefscape, combines pick-and-place with shooter play, though with a heavy emphasis on the former. The upcoming meeting, on <strong>Monday, January 6</strong>, will be a late night in order to continue design work and begin our build season.</p>

<div class="notice">
  <h2><strong>Activity Bus Cancelled</strong></h2>
  <p>Due to a lack of public funding, there will be <strong>no activity bus</strong> this year. We are still going to be holding meetings as previously scheduled, so the <strong>upcoming meeting on Monday, 9/9, will occur.</strong></p>
