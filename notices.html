  <h2><strong>Reefscape 2025 Kicks Off</strong></h2>
  <p>The 2025 FRC season kicked off on January 4, 2025, with a meeting at inglemoor to mark the event. The game, Reefscape, combines pick-and-place with shooter play, though with a heavy emphasis on the former. The upcoming meeting, on <strong>Monday, January 6</strong>, will be a late night in order to continue design work and begin our build season.</p>

  <h2><strong>Issues as of 1/22</strong></h2>
  <p><strong>Swerve</strong>: one of the swerve modules is "locked in place" -- that is, <strong>the wheel won't move</strong>. There is definitely an issue with the gears. Some of them are tilted. A fix will probably require some taking apart of the offending swerve module.
    <br><strong>Electronics</strong>: The new radio (vividhosting model) <strong>will not connect to the computers</strong>. This is likely some issue with how we are configuring it.
    <br> <strong>Operations</strong>: Procurement is causing delays. <strong>Parts have not arrived</strong> and this is slowing down progress.</p>
