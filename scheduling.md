## Off-Season Schedule  
During the off-season, a period from September to December and April to June, we meet once a week (usually Mondays) after school in room 600 (accessible through room 602, Mr. Donnelly's classroom).    
We spend this time usually polishing up our skills and finding others interested in the club. 

## Build Season  
From January until the start of Spring break, we are in *Build Season*, which is a fancy way of saying that we meet more often. Below is our schedule for build season. 

**Monday**  
3:20pm - 5:20pm

**Tuesday**  
3:20pm - 5:20pm

**Wednesday**  
1:50pm - 4:50pm

**Thursday**  
3:20pm - 5:20pm

**Friday**  
3:20pm - 4:20pm  

## Competitions  
We attend 2 regional competitions every year where we ~~battle~~ compete against other teams and their robots. If we do well enough in a regional competition, we advance to a district competition, and so on and so forth. As of yet we have never gotten particularly far, but we hope to eventually get there. Below is the schedule for the regionals we are attending this year, at Glacier Peak HS and Auburn HS.
