## Off-Season Schedule  
During the off-season, a period from **September to December and April to June**, we meet on **Mondays after school** and **Wednesdays during Viking Time(maybe after school)**. Our after-school meetings end when the activity bus comes. Our Viking Time meetings end when Viking Time does.
**The activity bus comes at 4:20 and leaves at 4:25. On Wednesday, it is at 3:05 P.M.**
## Build Season  
From January until the start of Spring break, we are in *Build Season*, which is a fancy way of saying that we meet more often. This means that we are going to meet **EVERY DAY** except the weekends. You don't have to stay for that long during build season but it will be helpful.
- Below is our schedule for the build season:

*Monday*: 3:20 P.M. - 5:20 P.M. 

*Tuesday*: 3:20 P.M. - 5:20 P.M.

*Wednesday*: 1:50 P.M. - 4:50 P.M. (activity bus leaves at 3:05 P.M.)

*Thursday*: 3:20 P.M. - 6:00 P.M. (longest day)

*Friday*: This day is **off** but most of the time it is. (3:20 P.M. - 5:20 P.M.)

**TBA**

## Competitions  
We attend 2 regional competitions every year where we ~~battle~~ compete against other teams and their robots. If we do well enough in a regional competition, we advance to a district competition, and so on and so forth. As of yet, we have never gotten particularly far, but we hope to eventually get there. Below is the schedule for the regionals we are attending this year, at Glacier Peak HS and Auburn HS.
