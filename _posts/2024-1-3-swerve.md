After a months-long offseason build, we have finally completed our version of swerve, and just in time for kickoff! During the process, we welcomed dozens of new members, learned the ropes of a new drive system, and, perhaps most impactfully of all, moved into a new, much more spacious room. Some say the most valuable part was the friends we made along the way, but we think the spinning and moving at the same time is pretty cool.
