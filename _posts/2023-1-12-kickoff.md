Finally! FRC Charged Up has released, with an interesting stack-and-sort game involving cones and inflatable blocks and an easy balance endgame. We don't have the stuff for swerve this year, so tank seems like a solid option - that, with a simple gripper for both items, should hopefully be solid at competition. Our hopes were however dashed at kickoff when, after 113 years oif anticipation, the FRC announced that "Water GAme" would not be played in 2023.
