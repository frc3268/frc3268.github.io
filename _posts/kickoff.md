Finally! FRC Charged Up has released, with an interesting stack-and-sort game involving cones and inflatable blocks and an easy balance endgame. We don't have the stuff for swerve this year, so tank seems like a solid option - that, with a simple gripper for both items, should hopefully be solid at competition.
